### 2D item

Let's create a lipstick item. Download the texture [here](/guides/custom-item/oraxen/lipstick.png){download="lipstick.png"}. (Texture made by Discord user danieyas üôè)

![Lipstick item texture](/guides/custom-item/oraxen/lipstick.webp)

Head into `plugins/Oraxen/items` and choose an existing yml file or create a new one with any name. This file will contain your item configurations.

Here's the base Oraxen item configuration:
```yml
lipstick:
  displayname: "<red>Lipstick"
  material: PAPER
```

Drop your texture into `plugins/Oraxen/pack/textures` (you can create any folders within, for example `/textures/myitems` or `/textures/magic`). For this guide, we'll put it into `/textures/myitems`

![myitems folder inside Oraxen/pack/textures](/guides/custom-item/oraxen/myitems_folder.webp)

Next, modify the above Oraxen item configuration:
```yml
lipstick:
  displayname: <red>Lipstick
  material: PAPER
  Pack:
    generate_model: true
    parent_model: item/generated
    textures:
    - myitems/lipstick.png
```

This adds a new section called `Pack` into your item, which tells Oraxen how to generate your model. 

* The `generate_model: true` is a simple switch to enable generation

* `parent_model: item/generated` dictates the path of the parent model. In this case, it's using Mojang's built-in model, which has some presets for how the model looks in-hand and other places.This is best understood by going into the Minecrafts default resource pack files and looking for the parent files. Best place to do so, is [mcasset.cloud](https://mcasset.cloud/){ext}. For example the `item/generated` is located [here](https://mcasset.cloud/1.20.3/assets/minecraft/models/item){ext} (search for `generated.json`).

* `textures` field declares a list of textures. Some models may require multiple textures (like for example blocks that have different faces, read more [here](https://docs.oraxen.com/configuration/item-appearance#create-a-simple-2d-item){ext}). In our case `item/generated` only needs one texture.

* This is best understood by going into the Minecrafts default resource pack files and looking for the parent files. Best place to do so, is [mcasset.cloud](https://mcasset.cloud/){ext}. For example the `item/generated` is located [here](https://mcasset.cloud/1.20.3/assets/minecraft/models/item){ext} (search for `generated.json`).

Done! Now just [get your item](#getting-items).

### 3D item (model)

For this example we'll use a ready, free [model from MC Models](https://mcmodels.net/model/izzys-fruit-basket/){ext}. Download the zip file from there.

![Fruit basket page](/guides/custom-item/oraxen/fruit_basket.webp)

Models include a texture, and in order for the model to work - it must be able to find that texture. From the just downloaded models folder, open `fruit_basket.json`. At the very top, we can see the following:
```json
{
    "credit": "Made with Blockbench",
	"texture_size": [64, 64],
	"textures": {
        "0": "item/fruit_basket_texture",
		"particle": "item/fruit_basket_texture"
	},
...
```
Looks like by default, this model will look for textures inside `assets/minecraft/textures/item`. You can change this path or let it stay. As an example, we'll change both textures in this model to `myitems/fruit_basket_texture` (notice .png is not specified). *Remember to save*.

Now we have to put our texture on that path. Put the `fruit_basket_texture.png` from the zip into `Oraxen/pack/textures/myitems`.

Then, drop the `fruit_basket.json` model into `Oraxen/pack/models`. Now, last step is to configure this model in Oraxen. Once again, head into `Oraxen/items` and find a suitable yml file.

Configure the item like so:

```yml
basket:
  displayname: <red>Fruit basket
  material: PAPER
  Pack:
    generate_model: false
    model: fruit_basket.json
```

Done! Now just [get your item](#getting-items).

### Extras

Oraxen allows you to configure items to have other advanced properties, such as lore, enchants, furniture and many other things. All these properties and their usage are documented on the [Items (Advanced) page](https://docs.oraxen.com/configuration/items-advanced){ext}.

To further change how an item looks or for details on how to configure items like bows and fishing rods, check out the [Item Appearance page](https://docs.oraxen.com/configuration/item-appearance){ext}.

## Getting items

<versions>

--- Oraxen

Once any changes have been made, execute the command `/oraxen reload all`. Once resource pack is reloaded and applied, you can find your item in `/oraxen inv` or `/oraxen give [player] [item]`
